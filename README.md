# SharkAttackAnalysis
The Shark Research Institute (SRI) maintains a log of shark attacks worldwide, the Global Shark Attack File (GSAF). It is continually updated as new incidents occur and was started in 1992 by the SRI. The purpose of the GSAF is to "use forensic analysis to demonstrate and emphasize the likelihood of shark/human interactions in comparison to the myriad dangers that we face in our daily lives. With a better understanding of these interactions we can minimize the possibility of being injured by a shark, and shift the discussion from fear to conservation of all shark species worldwide", per the SRI/GSAF website (https://www.sharks.org/global-shark-attack-file)

The current log file, in Excel form, can be downloaded from the "chronologically" link seen on the site below: https://www.sharks.org/global-shark-attack-file. My goal in this project is to clean and analyze shark incidents worldwide. Some of the areas of interest in this project include; type of incident (provoked or unprovoked) fatalities (how many people died or survived) the shark species involved the activity of the human when the shark attacked. top 10 countries with the most shark attack incidents. etc (Please feel free to come up with more interesting questions you'd like to uncover from this data)
